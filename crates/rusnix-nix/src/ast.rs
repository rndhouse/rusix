//! Describe the Nix syntax emitted by the backend.

//! An abstract syntax tree (AST) represents source code as expressions instead of

//! Normal configuration authors use `rusnix-ir`; they do not construct Nix syntax.
//! These constructors do not validate arbitrary trees. Invalid generated syntax
//! is a compiler failure when evaluated, not an error in user configuration.
